# Hello World - Basic Web3 App

This webapp is intended to be an introduction to web3 development, with an interface styled using Bootstrap that interacts with the [helloworld.sol](blockchain/helloworld.sol) contract deployed on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.

The HelloWorld.sol contract stores a string on the blockchain representing a message, and the auto-updating ui allows you to view and update the message stored on the blockchain.

Connect your wallet using MetaMask, and switch to the Mumbai testnet to try it out!

View the Contract on [Polyscan Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x09AE791F1Dc099aa9E155c8adc3c4222c41D4CA1)
