# Hello World - Basic Web3 App

This webapp is intended to be an introduction to web3 development, with an interface styled using Bootstrap that interacts with the [helloworld.sol](blockchain/helloworld.sol) contract deployed on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.

The HelloWorld.sol contract stores a string on the blockchain representing a message, and the auto-updating ui allows you to view and update the message stored on the blockchain.

Connect your wallet using MetaMask, and switch to the Mumbai testnet to try it out!
